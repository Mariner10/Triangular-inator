# Triangular-inator
Uses life360 API to access circle data, and store it away in daily .csv files for later viewing and data analysis.

### Credits to Harper Reed  (```https://github.com/pnbruckner/life360.git```) for creating the life360 client I used for this project.

## Setup

Make sure you make ammends to ```constants.py``` with your life360 username and password in order to effectively access the API. Also you need to create sub-folders within the logs folder, one for each member's ***first*** name in your group's circle.

> _For example_
```
   Triangular-inator/logs/Bob
   Triangular-inator/logs/Dylan
   Triangular-inator/logs/Pete
```
